## Data Science

I'm working on a book - with some fabulous co-authors - called "Data Science in Education Using R." It'll be out in 2020 from Routledge. It is a very fun project, and we're writing it in the open here. 
 

## Research

I do research focused on understanding and supporting college student success. I am curious about the ways in which tutoring and other support initiatives differentially impact students' motivation and career choices. 

## Teaching

I'm passionate about teaching, and my teaching philosophy is focused on (1) providing choices to students in the classroom and (2) enhancing motivation by helping students make personally relevant connections with the material.
